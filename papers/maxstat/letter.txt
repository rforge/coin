Dear Prof. Davidian,

we hereby would like to submit our manuscript entitled 

    Generalized Maximally Selected Statistics

to Biometrics; the manuscript is attached to this e-mail 
as a PDF file.

Maximally selected statistics for cutpoint estimation first appeared
(as maximally selected chi-square statistics) in a Biometrics paper 
in 1982. Since then, many extensions to continuous, censored or ordered 
response variables have been proposed, mostly published in Biometrics 
as well. The technique is well established in applied research and 
used extensively today, as studies published in highly ranked
medical and biological journals indicate.

We propose a new class of generalized maximally selected statistics
based on conditional inference techniques that contains many of the 
published tests as special cases and can easily be utilized to construct
new test procedures in less standard situations. We do so by deriving
a maximally selected log-rank statistic in two ordered categorical
variables (and their interaction) and applying it to survival times
of rectal cancer patients. Moreover, a special correlation structure
can be used to compute the asymptotic distribution of a large class
of maximally selected statistics in linear time.

Because of its unifying nature, we think that our manuscript is
appropriate for the `Consultant's Forum'-Section of Biometrics.

Sincerely yours,

Torsten Hothorn and Achim Zeileis
