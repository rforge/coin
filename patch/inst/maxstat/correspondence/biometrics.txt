Dear Dr. Hothorn:

Thank you for submitting a revision of your paper #070428CFR, "Generalized
maximally selected statistics," to Biometrics. Your paper has been reviewed
by the associate editor and one referee, whose reports are enclosed. Based
upon these reports, I am happy to inform you that we would be willing to
consider a revision that addresses the remaining concerns. The reviewers
were much happier with this revised manuscript and ask for some relatively
minor changes. Your main challenge will be to incorporate the additional
comments requested while maintaining the page limit. The associate editor's
report offers one strategy for achieving this.

Please make sure your revision is no more than 20 pages including appendices
and references, excluding the title page and abstract, figures and tables,
in a 12 point font, double space with 25 lines per page, plus no more than 4
tables and figures combined.

Please remove captions from figures and place them in a list on a separate
sheet.  Equations should use the [{()}] ordering, so that it is abs
[exp{log(x)}].

Along with the revision, please include a point-by-point response to all
reviewer comments, indicating how and where you have addressed them.

I am looking forward to receiving your revision.  Thank you for your
interest in Biometrics!

Yours sincerely,

Laurence S. Freedman
