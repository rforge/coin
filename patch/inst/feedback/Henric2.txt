Hi Torsten,

Sorry for the delayed answer, but I'm pretty busy myself at the moment
and tonight I'm off to Copenhagen for a week. Hopefully I'll find some
time to do a proper check then. However, I'm now somewhat convinced that
`mh_test' computes Stuart's test (p.422) rather than Bowker's test
(p.424).

I tried SAS 8.2, which supposedly computes Bowker's test, and it didn't
match the output from `mh_test', but gave X^2=238.0800 on _6_ df.

The output from `mh_test' has X^2=235.4957 on 3 df. Note that Agresti
(p.422), quoting Ireland (1969), gives a link between the tests of
Bhapkar (W) and Stuart (W0):
W=W0/(1-W0/n)=235.4957/(1-235.4957/55981)=236.4905. And numerically this
corresponds very well to the figure quoted for Bhapkar's test by Agresti
on p.423: W=236.5 on _3_ df. At least for this table, Bowker's test
seems rather more conservative than Bhapkar's. Since they seem to test
the same hypothesis, I do wonder which of these are closest to having
the correct size?]

In any case, if `mh_test' indeed is supposed to compute Bowker's test,
and apart from the test statistic, the df can't be correct. My reading
of p.424 (and SAS, which, of course, by no means correspond to the
universal truth) suggests that the df should be I*(I-1)/2=4*3/2=6 rather
than 3.


Best,
Henric
