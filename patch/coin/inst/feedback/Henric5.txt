No, how can we be sure of anything? ;-) 

I've tried a few other examples, and they're numerically close. E.g.
http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/jsuebersax/mcnemar.htm is
reproduced with

rating <- c("low", "moderate", "high")
Table6 <- as.table(matrix(c(20, 10,  5,
                             3, 30, 15,
                             0,  5, 40), 
                          ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE,
                          dimnames = list(Rater1 = rating, Rater2 =
rating)))
addmargins(Table6)
mh_test(Table6)

The original example in Stuart (1955) -- for your convenience, I've
attached the paper to this e-mail -- is reproduced using

grade <- c("highest", "second", "third", "lowest")
Vision <- as.table(matrix(c(1520,  266,  124,   66,
                             234, 1512,  432,   78,
                             117,  362, 1772,  205,
                              36,   82,  179,  492),
                          nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE,
                          dimnames = list(RightEye = grade, LeftEye =
grade)))
addmargins(Vision)
mh_test(Vision)

To be _really_ sure needs, of course, more work. And maybe I need to
understand more of the theory underlying `coin' in order to do that.
Also, judging from the conversation we had at useR, since these tests
aren't in the Strasser & Weber paper I'll probably have to read the C
code in `coin' to find out. And right now I'm not feeling *that*
masochistic... ;-)

Yes, I was very amused when I found out. :-)

Yeah, I know, but I can't figure out how to do the shading properly...
