o	definition of two-sided p-values in ansari.test contradicts the one
        used here in some cases (-> regtest_2samples.R)

o	confint() after contrast_test:	how to check if ranks were used???
	labels of `contrMat' and direction of differences don't match

o	check storage.mode of all vars going into C code (MC)

o	add wilcoxon-gehan scores, check logrank scores!

o	check if trend test for clustered data are part of the framework

o	maximally selected McNemar statistics -> Betensky, Biometrics, 2000

o	visualize deviations from H_0 for all problems (in a way
	motivated by shaded mosaicplots)
