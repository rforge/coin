o	check dimensions of x, y, xtrans and ytrans slots more carefully

o	definition of two-sided p-values in ansari.test contradicts the one
        used here in some cases (-> regtest_2samples.R)

o	confint() after contrast_test:	how to check if ranks were used???
	labels of `contrMat' and direction of differences don't match

o	check dimensions of objects returned by yfun() and xfun()
	dim(x) and dim(xtrans) may differ (max-test)

o	check storage.mode of all vars going into C code (MC)

o	add wilcoxon-gehan scores, check logrank scores!

o	check if trend test for clustered data are part of the framework
