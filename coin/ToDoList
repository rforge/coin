o	check dimensions of x, y, xtrans and ytrans slots more carefully

o	definition of two-sided p-values in ansari.test contradicts the one
        used here in some cases (-> regtest_2samples.R)

o	confint() after contrast_test:	how to check if ranks were used???
	labels of `contrMat' and direction of differences don't match

o	check dimensions of objects returned by yfun() and xfun()
	dim(x) and dim(xtrans) may differ (max-test)

o	check contrast_test with ranks

o	check Monte-Carlo P-values against exact ones in StatXact.

o	bowker_test -> mh_test (Marginal Homogenity, Agresti 1990?)

o	check storage.mode of all vars going into C code (MC)

o	add wilcoxon-gehan scores, check logrank scores!

o	check interrupt during MC

o	order x/yscores in lbl_test / response and input?
        (..., scores = list(var1 = c(1,..), var2 = c(...))

o	what means "trend test for clustered data"?
