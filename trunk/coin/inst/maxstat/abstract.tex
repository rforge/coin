Maximally selected statistics for the estimation of simple cutpoint models
are embedded into a generalized conceptual framework based on conditional inference
procedures. This powerful framework contains most of the published procedures
in this area as special cases, such as maximally selected $\chi^2$ and rank statistics, but
also allows for direct construction of new test procedures for less standard
test problems. As an application, a novel maximally selected rank statistic is derived from this
framework for a censored response partitioned with respect to two ordered
categorical covariates and potential interactions. This new test is employed
to search for a high-risk group of rectal cancer patients treated with a
neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
Moreover, a new efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the asymptotic distribution 
for a large class of maximally selected statistics is given enabling the
fast evaluation of a large number of cutpoints.
