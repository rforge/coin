Maximally selected statistics for the estimation of simple cutpoint models
are embedded into a powerful conceptual framework for conditional inference
procedures. 
Most of the published procedures in this area, such as maximally selected
$\chi^2$ and rank statistics, can be implemented as part of this general theory
A new efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the asymptotic distribution 
for a large class of maximally selected statistics utilizing a special 
product structure of the conditional covariance matrix is given.
We utilize the framework to search for a high-risk group of rectal
cancer patients treated with a neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy by means of a novel
maximally selected rank statistic for two unordered covariates and 
a censored response.
