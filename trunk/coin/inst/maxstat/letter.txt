Dear Prof. Davidian,

we hereby would like to submit our manuscript entitled 

    Generalized Maximally Selected Statistics

to Biometrics; the manuscript is attached to this email 
as a PDF file.

The first maximally selected statistics procedure, namely maximally selected 
chi-square statistics, was published by Biometrics in 1982. 
Since then, many extentions to
continuous, censored or ordered response variables have been proposed,
mostly published by Biometrics as well. The technique is well established in
applied research and used extensively today, as studies published in highly
ranked medical and biological journals indicate.

We show that most maximally selected statistics known today can be treated 
as special cases of a more general theory of conditional inference 
procedures. As a consequence, methods for new situations can be derived 
rather easily and we do so proposing a new method for maximally selected
log-rank statistics in two ordered categorical variables.

Moreover, a special correlation structure can be used to compute the
asymptotic distribution of a large class of maximally selected statistics
in linear time. Because of its unifying nature, our manuscript would be
appropriate for the `Consultant's Forum'-Section of Biometrics.

Sincerely yours,

Torsten Hothorn and Achim Zeileis
