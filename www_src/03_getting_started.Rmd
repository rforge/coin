Your first regression tree
========================================================

First, install and fire-up R on your computer. Within R, one needs to
install the coin package by typing

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("coin")
```

and hitting the ENTER key. Once the package is installed, you can
load it using

```{r results: hide}
library("coin")
```

Now all coin functions are ready to be used, for example the independence_test()
function for testing independence of two variables, for example the relationship
between income and job satisfaction in women:

```{r}
### for females only
x <- as.table(jobsatisfaction[,,"Female"])
independence_test(x)
```
